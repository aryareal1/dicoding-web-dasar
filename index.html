              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Arya Dwiputra, an Indonesian vocational high school
                student majoring in Software Engineering. I have a strong
                interest in software development, particularly in web
                technologies and modern application design. I am passionate
                about learning how software systems are built, optimized, and
                maintained in real-world environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                Throughout my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in
                programming concepts and problem-solving skills. I enjoy
                transforming ideas into functional applications and continuously
                strive to improve the quality, performance, and usability of the
                software I create.

              <h3>Educational Background</h3>
              <p>
                I am currently pursuing my education at a vocational high
                school, where I focus on software engineering subjects such as
                programming, web development, and basic system design. My
                academic activities help me understand both theoretical concepts
                and practical implementation through hands-on projects.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to formal education, I actively learn outside the
                classroom by exploring documentation, tutorials, and community
                resources. This self-learning approach allows me to stay updated
                with current technologies and industry practices.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Personal Interests and Goals</h3>
              <p>
                I am particularly interested in becoming a full-stack web
                developer, as it allows me to work on both frontend and backend
                aspects of an application. I enjoy understanding how user
                interfaces interact with server-side logic and databases to form
                complete systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                My long-term goal is to build scalable and maintainable web
                applications while continuously developing my technical and
                professional skills. I am also interested in collaborating with
                others and contributing to meaningful projects.

              <h2>My Tech Stack</h2>
              <p>
                I have experience working with a variety of web development
                tools and technologies. My primary focus is on building clean,
                structured, and maintainable applications using modern
                development workflows.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
              <p>
                I mainly use JavaScript and TypeScript as my primary programming
                languages for web development. I understand core programming
                concepts such as variables, data types, control structures,
                functions, and object-oriented principles. I also have basic
                experience with C#, which helps me broaden my understanding of
                different programming paradigms.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
              <p>
                For frontend development, I work with HTML and CSS to build
                structured and accessible web pages. I frequently use React and
                React-based frameworks to develop dynamic, component-based user
                interfaces that enhance user experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                I use Tailwind CSS to efficiently design responsive layouts and
                maintain consistent styling across projects. This approach
                allows me to focus on functionality while still producing
                visually clean and modern interfaces.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Backend Development and Databases</h3>
              <p>
                On the backend side, I have experience using Node.js and Express
                to develop RESTful APIs. I am familiar with handling requests,
                managing routes, and implementing basic authentication and data
                processing logic.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including
                PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Supabase. I understand
                fundamental database concepts such as data modeling,
                relationships, and basic query operations, and I continue to
                improve my knowledge in this area.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>Development Tools and Workflow</h3>
              <p>
                I regularly use Git and GitHub for version control and project
                collaboration. I am accustomed to using development tools such
                as Postman for API testing and package managers to manage
                dependencies efficiently.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also value clean code practices, consistent formatting, and
                proper project structure, as these aspects are essential for
                building maintainable and professional software.
